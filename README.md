# Programming-lang-recomendation-
This is a simple expert system written in Prolog that recommends programming languages based on user preferences. It asks the user a series of questions about their needs and interests (e.g., "Do you want an easy-to-learn language?") and then suggests suitable programming languages based on those preferences.
